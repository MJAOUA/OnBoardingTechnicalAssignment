To run the Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

1. Open the `application.properties` file.
2. Change the application port by modifying the following line:

```
3. Run the following command to start the application:

```

## Utilization
To use the API, follow these steps:

1. Run the Spring Boot application.
2. Make requests to the API using tools like Postman.
3. Use the `/v1/api` path to interact with the API.
4. You can add filter or sorting parameters to the API requests:
- `merchant`: Filter by merchant name.
- `amount`: Filter by transaction amount.
- `status`: Filter by transaction status.
- `sortBy`: Specify the field for sorting.
- `sortOrder`: Specify the sorting order (ascending or descending).
